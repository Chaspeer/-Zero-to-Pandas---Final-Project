### Hey, thanks for coming! Below you will be albe to take a look at the different projects that I have been working on during the last time. There is a mix of Machine Learning and visualization projects, using R and Python. Enjoy! 

# [Argentina COVID-19 Analysis - R Programming](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Data-Science.Projects/blob/main/COVID.ipynb)

### Here you will find some interesting vizualizations about the COVID-19 situation in Argentina. I have used information from February 2020 to September 2020 and analyzed different paramenters providede the the Ministry of Heath. Also, I have a applied a logarithmic regression model to predict if people will recover from COVID or not. (In progress)

# [Titanic Visualization - Final Pandas Project](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Data-Science.Projects/blob/main/zerotopandas_course_project.ipynb)

### In this code, you will see some curious concepts about the famous Titanic Dataset. There are different bar charts and histograms that help us to understand the situation that this dataset represents.
